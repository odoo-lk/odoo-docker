Come take my journey
Into night
Come be my shadow
Walk at my side
And when you see
All that I have seen
Can you tell me
Love from pride?
I have been waiting
all this time
for one to wake me
one to call mine
So when you're near
all that you hold dear
do you fear what you will find?
As the dawn
Breaks through the night
I move on
Forever longing for the home
I found in your eyes
I will be listening
for the drum
to call me over
far away from
my tender youth
and the very truth
showing me what I've become
As the dawn
Breaks through the night
I move on
Forever longing for the home
I found in your eyes
Your voice
saw me through the night
