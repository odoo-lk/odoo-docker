1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come take my journey

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Into night

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Come be my shadow

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Walk at my side

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And when you see

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All that I have seen

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Can you tell me

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Love from pride?

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have been waiting

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
all this time

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
for one to wake me

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
one to call mine

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So when you're near

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
all that you hold dear

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
do you fear what you will find?

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As the dawn

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Breaks through the night

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I move on

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Forever longing for the home

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I found in your eyes

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I will be listening

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
for the drum

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to call me over

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
far away from

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
my tender youth

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and the very truth

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
showing me what I've become

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
As the dawn

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Breaks through the night

30
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I move on

31
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Forever longing for the home

32
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I found in your eyes

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Your voice

34
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
saw me through the night
