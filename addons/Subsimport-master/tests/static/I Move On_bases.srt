1
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,180
Come take my journey

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,940
Into night

3
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,860
Come be my shadow

4
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,620
Walk at my side

5
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,550
And when you see

6
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,890
All that I have seen

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,580
Can you tell me

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,310
Love from pride?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,940
I have been waiting

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,520
all this time

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,490
for one to wake me

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,200
one to call mine

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,120
So when you're near

14
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,370
all that you hold dear

15
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:19,690
do you fear what you will find?

16
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,280
As the dawn

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,630
Breaks through the night

18
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,230
I move on

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,540
Forever longing for the home

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,770
I found in your eyes

21
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,510
I will be listening

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,170
for the drum

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,300
to call me over

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,720
far away from

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,560
my tender youth

26
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,810
and the very truth

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,900
showing me what I've become

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,390
As the dawn

29
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,470
Breaks through the night

30
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,890
I move on

31
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,300
Forever longing for the home

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,100
I found in your eyes

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,530
Your voice

34
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,310
saw me through the night
